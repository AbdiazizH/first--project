    <h2 class="Introductory">Introductory of the band and why they are my favorite band</h1>
    my favorite music band is Meen.
    The first band in Lebanon to release its music under the creative commons license,
    Meen is certainly a landmark of Lebanese music.
    From humble beginnings performing in universities the band has moved up,
    releasing several albums since its formation in 2006.
    Their music alludes to Lebanese humor as they tackle serious issues in a sarcastic light.
    They play a type of alternative rock music,
    and I find their music to be filled with energy,
    which always brings me to good mood and made me to get up
    dance and sing.Their music is catchy and fun to listen.
